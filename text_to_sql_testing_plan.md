# Text-to-SQL LLM Application Performance Testing Plan

## Executive Summary

This comprehensive testing plan establishes a framework for evaluating text-to-SQL LLM applications with emphasis on model accuracy, consistency, and error detection. The plan encompasses both explicit error detection (syntax errors, execution failures) and silent error identification (semantically incorrect but executable queries), along with ongoing performance monitoring strategies.

## 1. Testing Objectives

### Primary Goals
- **Accuracy Assessment**: Measure the model's ability to generate correct SQL queries from natural language inputs
- **Consistency Evaluation**: Ensure stable performance across similar queries and repeated executions
- **Error Detection**: Identify both explicit failures and silent errors that produce incorrect results
- **Performance Benchmarking**: Establish baseline metrics for ongoing comparison

### Key Performance Indicators (KPIs)
- **Execution Success Rate**: Percentage of queries that execute without syntax/runtime errors
- **Semantic Accuracy Rate**: Percentage of executable queries that return correct results
- **Consistency Score**: Variation in performance across similar query types
- **Silent Error Rate**: Percentage of queries that execute but return incorrect data
- **Response Time**: Average time to generate SQL queries
- **Schema Adherence Rate**: Percentage of queries that properly reference database schema

## 2. Test Environment Setup
